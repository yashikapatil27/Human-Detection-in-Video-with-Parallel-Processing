# DSC520 - Final Project
## Human-Detection-in-Video-with-Parallel-Processing using YOLOv3

Project Work for DSC520 - High Performance Scientific Computing, Fall 2023: This repository provides the implementation of a human face detection solution using various parallel computing approaches: OpenMP, MPI, and MPI Broadcast. The problem is addressed using the YOLOv3 model for object detection with the ImageAI library.

## Dependencies
Refer to requirements.txt

## Execution

1. **Serial code (serial.py):**
   ```bash
   python3 serial.py

2. **OpenMP code (omp.py)**
    ```bash
    python3 omp.py

3. **MPI (mpi.py)**
    ```bash
    mpiexec -n <num_processes> python3 mpi.py

To run using 2, 4, and 8 number of processes, run the script file, mpi.sh using the command
    ```bash
    ./mpi.sh

4. **MPI Broadcast (mpi_bcast.py)**
    ```bash
    mpiexec -n <num_processes> python3 mpi_bcast.py

To run using different number of processes, i.e. 2, 4, and 8, run the script file, mpi.sh using the command
    ```bash
    ./mpi_bcast.sh
